# How the Russian Sanctions impact the European energy market

Dorottya Frisch

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
My current goal is to look at how the European energy market has been reshaped after the implementations of the sanctions on Russia in 2021.
It has not really changed since the proposal, however I think my project currently focuses too heavily on how the natural gas market changed, 
and not the entire energy market. I still want to do the project on the energy market, but am unsure how to visualize it.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
All of the data I used is real data, however, the biggest challenge I am facing is that I could not find 2024 data for all aspects of the 
energy sector, therefore I had to be selective with what I can visualize. 

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.

Draft 1: This is a line graph showing how energy prices have changed in Europe between 2016 and 2024 with a line highlighting when the sanctions 
were implemented. I want to use this graph to show how the energy crisis in Europe led to prices soaring, and this in turn led to what we can 
see in Draft 2.

Draft 2: This is a line graph of gas consumption in the EU between 2016 and 2024. While gas consumption is cyclical by nature, the graph still
shows how both in 2023 and in 2024 gas consumption has declined. I want to tie this together with soaring prices and highlight how especially
in 2023, the energy crisis impacted a lot of people who could no longer afford to heat their home.

Draft 3: This is a map showing the dependence of each EU country on Russian gas. After looking at how rising prices impacted the EU as a whole, 
I want to spend al little time talking about which countries were the most heavily impacted, and also use this map to show the severity of
some countries' dependence to further highlight the magnitude of the situation.

Draft 4 & 5: These two bar charts show how energy sources are distributed in the EU. One of the pie charts show this distribution before the 
sanctions, the other one after. These charts are meant to illustrate how the EU adapted after the sanctions, and what measures it took to 
try and replace all of the natural gas and energy lost due to the sanctions.

Draft 6: This bubble chart complements Drafts 4 & 5 as it is a dot chart showing the percentage change in the usage of renewable energy sources
by EU country. With this graph I want to continue the theme of looking at how EU countries adapted, and since the pie charts revealed an increase
in renewable energy, I want to explore which EU countries invested the most in this sector. 

Draft 7: This grouped bar chart continues to explore how the EU adapted to the sanctions, and looks at what other alternative natural gas sources
the EU decided to use instead of Russia. Here I also want to discuss who the biggest winners of the sanctions were, which in this case is Norway
and the United States.

Draft 8: This stacked area chart shows the amount of gas imported through the four main Russian pipelines that supply the EU with natural gas.
This graph might be placed at the top of the presentation instead, but right now I wanted to put it at the end to show that even now, the EU
is not completely free of Russian gas, as it still allows a few EU countries to import it. However, the magnitude of those imports has significantly
shifted, and if the war in Ukraine is to continue, the goal of the EU is to get the number of imports down to 0.

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
My final envisioning was a hybrid between an article and a poster. This topic would not be as impactful without a little bit of explanatory
text, however I do not want to dwell too much on energy politics. I am not entirely sure though on the form of my final deliverable, that
was one of the aspects I wanted feedback on.
