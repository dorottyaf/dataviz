# Project title: 
# Reshaping the European Energy Sector: Europe's Divorce from Russian Gas

Name: Dorottya Frisch

Project Description:
My project explored how the Russian sanctions against the import of natural gas shaped the European Union's energy sector.
I looked at the energy sector both before and after the ssanctions, looked at the change in natural gas imports, and all in all
tried to give a comprehensive overview of the impact these sanctions had on the EU.

Data Sources:
This project used three distinct sources of data. 

Charts 1-3 and 7 used the Eurostat database;
Chart 1 used the nrg_pc_204 dataset (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/product/view/nrg_pc_204?category=nrg.nrg_price.nrg_pc),
Chart 2 used the nrg_cb_gasm dataset (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/product/view/nrg_cb_gasm?category=nrg.nrg_quant.nrg_quantm.nrg_cb_m),
Chart 3 used the nrg_ti_gas dataset (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/product/view/nrg_ti_gas?category=nrg.nrg_quant.nrg_quanta.nrg_t.nrg_ti),
and Chart 7 used the nrg_ti_gas and nrg_ti_gasm dataset (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/product/view/nrg_ti_gasm?category=nrg.nrg_quant.nrg_quantm.nrg_t_m.nrg_ti_m).
All data was used fairly under their copyright policy:

Charts 4-6 used the Monthly Electricity Data dataset from Ember Data (https://ember-energy.org/data/monthly-electricity-data/).
The data is freely available on their website, and after emailing them, they confirmed that it is fair for me to use.

Chart 8 used data from ENTSOG, which stands for the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas.
(https://transparency.entsog.eu/#/map?loadBalancingZones=false)
They publish weekly data to increase transparency about the transmission of gas within Europe, and have freely usable datasets
